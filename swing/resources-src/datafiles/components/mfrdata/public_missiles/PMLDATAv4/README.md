# Public Missiles Ltd. (PML) parts data in RockSim format

These csv files were pulled from the PML website https://publicmissiles.com on 1 Jan 2018.
They are intended for versions of RockSim 4.0 and earlier.

There is a note on the website saying that "all of these files are already included in RockSim 5.0 and higher".
So it's possible they do not match the files that PML has provided to RockSim.

A quick inspection of the files shows that they do not appear to include the newer "Quantum" tubing.
